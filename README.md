### Error Description
When booting from 'Manjaro-USB-installation-stick' it take at first to long and then appear the Terminal instead of GUI (graphical user interface) with following error-message:
```
ERROR: ‘/dev/disk/by-label/’ device did not show up after 30 seconds...

#
```

this happen sometimes independently of the fact that you start with or without proprietary drivers. I think this happen when a newer 'Manjaro.ISO' appear, but, there is a simple remedy to that/this situation, read solution ==>
### Solution
**Step 1.:** Disconnect USB-stick from your computer.

**Step 2.:** Reconnect USB-stick again and...

**Step 3.:** Type in the already/still open terminal following Code:

`exit`

confirm this command hitting/pressing [ENTER] key, the GUI appear immediately and you can continue to install the OS (operating system) as usually and without any disadvantage.
